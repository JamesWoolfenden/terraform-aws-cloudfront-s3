This Terraform module is to provision a private S3 bucket, and use it as a static website, and sit that behind a Cloudfront distribution.
Certificate needs a delay adding before cloudfron uses it, until then run it twice.

## Usage

Creates a static site with cloudfront distribution in front.

![alt text](./diagram/static_site.png)

To use, add **module.cloudfront.tf** to your template and update your variables and values, see *example/examplea* for a full worked example.

```hcl
module "cloudfront" {
  source       = "JamesWoolfenden/cloudfront-s3/aws"
  version      = "0.3.1"
  common_tags = var.common_tags
  bucket_name = var.bucket_name
}
```

The default ttl values have been set very low, you will override these (but oh so helpful for development), for a more effective cache.

## Checkov Exclusion

I have added:

```checkov
  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_52: "Ensure S3 bucket has MFA delete enabled"
  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_19: "Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket is securely encrypted at rest"
```

As we will want to deploy to this bucket and it needs to be readable to the world if it's a website.
There are also some exceptions on the logging bucket, e.g. logging of the logging bucket.
